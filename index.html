          <p>So how much does TikTok pay you?</p>
          <p>
            Here’s the QUICK answer: TikTok pays 2 to 4 cents per 1000 views.
          </p>
          <p>
            TikTok pays a tiny percentage of its profits and revenue to its
            creators, unlike YouTube.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means, if any of your TikTok videos generate 1 million views,
            you can make anywhere around $20 to $40.
          </p>

          <h3><span id="tiktok-creator-fund">TikTok Creator Fund</span></h3>
          <p>
            One of the best ways to earn from TikTok is to join “TikTok’s
            Creator Fund”.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is officially funded by TikTok to reward creators for their
            content.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            To get paid from TikTok, you will have to apply for the creator’s
            fund and if you meet its criteria, you’ll get paid per 1000
            views.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            All the TikTok creators who want to make money on the platform will
            need at least 100,000 video views in the last 30 days to be eligible
            to join the Creator Fund.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Are there any eligibility criteria to join the Creator
              Fund?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, if you’re a TikTok video creator, you need the following things
            to be eligible to apply to the Creator Fund:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You should be from the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain, or Italy
            </li>
            <li>At least 18 years old</li>
            <li>Have at least 10,000 followers</li>
            <li>Have at least 100,000 video views in the last 30 days</li>

            No, it’s NOT! As we already mentioned, TikTok pays peanuts even if
            you generate millions of views.
          </p>

            For example, if your TikTok video gets one billion views, you can
            expect anywhere between $20,000 to $40,000.&nbsp;

          <p>
            If you have more than 10,000 followers, you can add clickable links
            in your TikTok stories, to promote affiliate products.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t have 10K followers yet, you can change your account to
            a TikTok Business account (free of charge) and add a link to your
            TikTok bio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The #1 reason to consider TikTok for affiliate marketing is this:
            TikTok has over 1 billion users from 150 countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means you have access to a HUGE audience across the world who’s
            interested in a TON of things that you may want to promote as an
            affiliate.&nbsp;

          <h3><span id="2-paid-sponsors">2. Paid Sponsors</span></h3>
          <p>
            One of the popular ways to monetize your TikTok account is to get
            sponsors. Almost all the top-paid TikTok celebrities have BIG
            sponsors who pay millions of dollars every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, one of the most followed TikToker Charli D Amelio charges
            over $100,000 for every single sponsored post she does on her
            account.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to IZEA’s platform data from the past eight years, a
            sponsor has to pay around&nbsp; $2,741 per post to influencers.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, try getting your first 10K or 100K followers on TikTok
            if you want to get sponsors for your videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few proven ways to get sponsors to make money from
            TikTok.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Be professional: </strong>Use professional photos and a bio
            in your profile. Make sure to include a call to action (or callout)
            to brands to indicate you’re open to sponsorships.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            If possible, mention your email address or website address in your
            bio so other brands can easily find you for sponsorships.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Show social proof: </strong>Most brands want to work with
            people who can help with better engagement or visibility. So it’s a
            good idea to link out to other social media profiles if you have a
            huge following. If you’ve already worked with several brands,
            mention them in your bio or TikTok videos to attract even more
            brands to endorse you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Create non-sponsored TikTok videos:</strong> If you’re just
            getting started without sponsors, try creating videos that sponsor
            products. Make them engaging and organic.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can generate sales even from non-sponsored videos, you can
            easily persuade brands to pay you in the long run.

            As you can see, the hashtag “small business challenge” has over 6.7
            million views. Similarly, you can make relevant videos using
            hashtags to reach more people on the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Analyze others’ products:</strong> Make a list of all the
            people who’re selling their products on TikTok. Find out how they’re
            marketing and selling their products such as merchandise, toys,
            fashion items, etc. It will give you a ton of ideas for marketing
            your own products.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Engage with your audience:</strong> Always keep in touch
            with your audience. Educate them about the products you sell. Teach
            them how those products can help them or save them time. If your
            videos are engaging enough, they’ll make a purchase. Try offering
            special incentives to your audience to get better conversions.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Promote: </strong>Last but not least, promote the products
            you sell. The best part about TikTok is that it offers Creator tools
            that help you easily promote your products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few options you can choose while promoting on TikTok;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>More video views</li>
            <li>More website visits</li>
            <li>More followers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Pick any one of the above goals, experiment, and analyze the
            results. If paid promotion is what works well for you, keep
            investing more.&nbsp;

                    As for the TikTok Creator Fund, you can earn between 2 and 4
                    cents for every 1000 views. That means, if your videos
                    generate 1 million views on TikTok, you can expect to
                    generate $20 to $40.

            Although TikTok officially pays very little through its creator fund
            but there are many other ways to increase your earnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, there are a few TikTokers who earn several
            million dollars every single year from various sources such as
            sponsorships, paid collaborations, mentions, etc.
          </p>
